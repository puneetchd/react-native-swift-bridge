# react-native-swift-bridge

Utility for never having to write Objective-C bridging code for your swift app again!

# Usage

```
cd /path/to/my/module
rnsb
```

This will scan your swift files, make the bridge based on exposed (with the `@objc` attribute) classes, methods and properties. A file called rn-swift-bridge will be created and - if it is not already - added to your module.

# Watch mode: rnsb --watch

Watches for changes in swift files in your module, and rebuilds the .m bridge on the fly.

```
cd /path/to/my/module
rnsb --watch
```

# Tips

1.  The utility does not support `@objcmembers` yet so you need to indicate which classes, methods and properties to expose via individual `@objc` tags
2.  When working with types it cannot identify (e.g. enums that are implicitly ints) it needs a little help on a prior line: add a line comment like so:

```
//@rn type=NSInteger
@objc var worldAlignment:ARConfiguration.WorldAlignment {
```

3.  When working with RCTViewManager, it will auto-detect the name of the view you are managing using the same RN heuristic - the view is the name of the manager minus the word "Manager". So "RHDViewManager" manages "RHDView". However, if your naming conventions do not match to this, you can tell the bridge the name of the view to manage exposing view props.

```swift
// @rn view=RHDARView
@objc(RHDARViewManager)
class RHDARViewManager: RCTViewManager {
    /*...*/
}
```
